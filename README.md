## Features

- **One-shot railgun.** No health, no armor, no other weapons. Pure duel of aim + movement.
- **Quake-style movement.** Strafe-jump acceleration, air control, directional dash, double-jump, wall-jump, and a damage-free boost-jump off surfaces.
- **Game modes** — Free-for-all, **Duel** (1v1, first to the frag limit), **Team Deathmatch** (Red vs Blue), **Last-Man-Standing**, and a **Ranked Duel** Elo ladder (login-only 1v1). Pre-match 3-2-1 countdown, mercy-rule blowout ends.
- **Server-authoritative multiplayer** with serious netcode (see [below](#the-netcode) — it's the most interesting engineering in the repo):
  - Lag compensation — the server rewinds every target to the shooter's render time before raycasting hitboxes. What you saw is what you hit.
  - 64 Hz binary snapshots, clock sync, fixed-delay interpolation of remotes, dead-reckoning through packet loss.
  - Anti-cheat: fire-rate gate, shot-origin sanity, horizontal **and vertical** speed clamps, message-rate flood guard, and a statistical **aimbot heuristic** (rolling hit/headshot-rate throttle).
  - **Reconnect / session resume** — a mid-match drop holds your slot + score for a grace window.
- **Rooms & lobby.** Quick-match (per mode), public custom lobbies, and private invite-code matches. End-of-match **map voting** + a **3D podium** of the top 3 (wearing their hats, playing their emotes).
- **Weekly challenge + replays.** A fixed weekly speedrun gauntlet with full-run **replay recording** — anyone can rewatch the leaderboard's runs in a first-person replay viewer.
- **Progression.** XP / levels / credits bound to an optional account (guest progress stays local), daily/weekly **challenges**, and a first-win-of-the-day bonus.
- **Cosmetics Locker.** Hats, kill-effects, rail-beam colors, "unusual" particles, emotes, killcam playercards, spawn effects, titles, crosshairs, and **announcer voice packs**. Level- or credit-gated, with an unboxing spinner and a live 3D preview. Purely visual — never an advantage. Ownership-checked server-side.
- **Offline play.** Bots with adjustable difficulty (human-like aim/movement, wearing cosmetics), solo FFA/TDM/Duel, and a training range — no server needed.
- **Juice + feedback.** Killcams, multi-kill medals, announcer (with optional captions), shockwave hit-markers, a red damage vignette, and a fully configurable crosshair.
- **Stats + leaderboards.** Per-browser K/D, accuracy, streaks, headshots (no login required) and a server-wide leaderboard with **All-time / Weekly / Daily** windows.
- **Onboarding & accessibility.** First-run name prompt + controls primer; reduced-effects toggle, announcer captions + a screen-reader live region, bright-enemy colorblind aid, full keybind remapping, and UI scaling.
- **Admin dashboard** (`/admin`) — KPIs, activity/retention timeseries, match + player drill-downs, and a moderated **player feedback / bug report** inbox (in-game "Send feedback" lands there, filterable by bug / feature request / general).

## The netcode

The hot path is engineered like a real arena shooter, not a tech demo. The
short version:

| Piece | How it works |
| --- | --- |
| **Tick rates** | Client sim, position upload, and server snapshots all run at **64 Hz**. Hits are event-driven and sub-tick. |
| **Binary wire** | The two hot messages are hand-packed binary ([`netcodec.ts`](src/game/netcodec.ts)): state rows quantize position to i16 (3.9 mm) → **~30–35 B/player/tick**; everything rare stays JSON. |
| **State/meta split** | Per-tick snapshots carry only numbers; identity + cosmetics ride a separate `meta` channel sent **only on change**. |
| **Anti-alias resample** | The server resamples every player's received positions to one consistent instant (per-sender adaptive lag, 20–180 ms) before snapshotting — and records **the same pose** into lag-comp history, so render == rewind *by construction*. |
| **Lag compensation** | Shots carry the shooter's `renderTime`; the server rewinds every hitbox to exactly what was on the shooter's screen (favor-the-shooter, clamped at 350 ms). |
| **Interpolation** | Remotes render at a **fixed** delay (110 ms @ 2p → 170 ms @ 8p, slewed on roster change — never derived from arrival timing, which wobbles under TCP). Dead-reckoning covers brief loss. |
| **Transport** | WebSocket with Nagle off + backpressure-aware sends, behind a **transport seam** that's ready for QUIC datagrams — a WebTransport channel is built and E2E-tested, gated on UDP ingress ([the plan](docs/NETCODE-UDP-PLAN.md)). |
| **Headroom** | The 64 Hz loop holds **1200 simulated clients** on one core ([`scripts/netcode-stress.ts`](scripts/netcode-stress.ts)); `loopLagMs` on `/api/live` is the always-on event-loop health gauge. |

| Game server  | Node.js + [`ws`](https://github.com/websockets/ws), run via `tsx`  |
| HTTP / API   | Express (static client + stats/auth/admin APIs)                     |
| Store        | SQLite via `better-sqlite3` (no ORM, no migrations)                |
| Language     | TypeScript end to end                                               |

No game engine, no networking library, no framework on the hot path — the
interesting parts are all in this repo.

## Quick start

**Prerequisites:** Node **≥ 20.19** (the build/toolchain needs it). With
[`fnm`](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) or `nvm`, e.g. `fnm use 20.19.0`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/8tp/elyxion.git
cd elyxion
npm install
npm run dev
```

`npm run dev` runs two processes together (via `concurrently`):

- **Vite** dev server on <http://localhost:5173> — the client, with HMR.
- **Game server** on `:8787` — the WebSocket game + APIs.

Vite proxies `/api` and `/ws/elyxion` to the game server, so the browser always
talks to a **single origin** — exactly like production. Open
<http://localhost:5173> and hit **Enter the arena**.

You can also run them separately: `npm run dev:web` and `npm run dev:server`.

### Production

```bash
npm run build      # vite build -> dist/
npm start          # NODE_ENV=production tsx server/index.ts
# or both at once:
npm run serve
```

In production the **single Node server** (default port `8787`) serves the built
client from `dist/`, the APIs under `/api`, and the game socket at
`/ws/elyxion` — all on one port. Put any TLS terminator / reverse proxy /
CDN in front of it; the WebSocket rides the same origin. See
[`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for the Railway + Cloudflare setup
the live site runs on.

## Controls

| Input              | Action                              |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Mouse              | Aim                                 |
| Left click         | Fire railgun (one shot, one kill)   |
| `W` `A` `S` `D`    | Move                                |
| `Space`            | Jump (double-jump in the air)       |
| `Shift`            | Dash (directional, on a cooldown)   |
| Jump into a wall   | Wall-jump                           |
| `Esc`              | Release mouse / open the menu       |

All keybinds, mouse sensitivity (cm/360), FOV, crosshair, and volumes are
configurable in the in-game **Settings** menu and persist in `localStorage`.

---

## Game modes

Pick a mode in the menu before Quick Match or Create Match (quick-match only
pairs you with rooms of the same mode).

| Mode | Players | Win condition |
| ---- | ------- | ------------- |
| **Free-for-all** | up to 8 | First player to the frag limit ends the match → map vote. |
| **Duel (1v1)** | 2 | A single race to the frag limit — no rounds, no pauses. Leaving mid-match forfeits. A login-only **Ranked Duel** ladder uses the same format with Elo. |
| **Team Deathmatch** | up to 8 | Red vs Blue. Friendly fire is off; first team to the team frag limit wins. |
| **Last-Man-Standing** | up to 8 | Rounds; lose a life per death, last player alive takes the round. |

Mode tunables (frag/round limits, team sizes, colors) live in
`src/game/constants.ts` and are shared verbatim by the client and the
authoritative server.

---

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (or set the vars in your process manager). All are
optional:

| Variable        | Default            | Purpose                                                        |
| --------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PORT`          | `8787`             | Port the Node server listens on.                               |
| `HOST`          | `0.0.0.0` (prod)   | Bind address.                                                  |
| `DATA_DIR`      | `./data`           | Directory for runtime data (the SQLite DB).                    |
| `DATABASE_PATH` | `./data/elyxion.sqlite` | Explicit DB file path (overrides `DATA_DIR`).           |
| `APP_BASE_URL`  | _(unset)_          | Production WebSocket origin allow-list. When set, only browsers loading the app from this origin may open the game socket. Unset = same-origin only. |
| `ADMIN_USERNAMES` | _(unset)_        | Comma-separated account names auto-promoted to admin.          |

```

The modules under `src/game/` that the server imports (`arena-data`,
`constants`, `types`, `netcodec`) are deliberately Three.js-free — the server
owns spawns, tunables, and the wire format without pulling in a renderer.

## Stats & privacy

Accounts are **optional**: you play as a guest by default, and can register an
optional username/password account (no email required) to carry your XP, levels,
cosmetics, and rank across devices — progression is bound to the account
server-side. Casual/offline stats are reported by the client, so they're clamped
server-side but **best-effort and not anti-cheated**; ranked Duel Elo and
multiplayer match results, by contrast, are server-authoritative.

---

## Audio assets

Announcer voice lines and multi-kill medal callouts ship as `.ogg` files in
`public/sounds/elyxion/`. The railgun **fire / hit / kill** SFX have no bundled
clip and are **synthesized procedurally** via the Web Audio API at runtime. Drop
a matching `.ogg` at the path listed in `src/game/audio.ts` (`SOUND_URLS`) to
override any sound; missing announcer lines fall back to speech synthesis.

---

## npm scripts

| Script             | What it does                                              |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`      | Vite client + game server together (dev).                |
| `npm run dev:web` / `dev:server` | Each on its own.                            |
| `npm run build`    | Production client build to `dist/`.                      |
| `npm start`        | Run the production server (expects `dist/`).             |
| `npm run serve`    | `build` then `start`.                                    |
| `npm run typecheck`| Type-check client and server projects.                   |
| `npm run lint`     | ESLint.                                                  |
| `npm run netcode:load` | Netcode load harness against a local server.         |

### Anticheat

The server is authoritative for hits and movement, so it can't be fooled into
scoring a cheater — but modified clients can still try to *poison the game*:
teleport/fly movement (feeds snapshots + lag-comp rewind), shots fired faster
than the rail cooldown, rays cast from off your eye (shooting through walls),
and statistically impossible aim. Each attempt is dropped/rejected/throttled
server-side and recorded in the **anticheat feed** (`GET /api/admin/anticheat`,
worker/read-only token or session; also on the admin dashboard → **Anticheat**
tab): stopped hacks, aimbot flags, kicked/blocked/timeout actions, and every
ban applied or lifted. The feed is in-memory and bounded.

Watch it catch real cheats from the browser console (no server flags needed):

1. Open the game in a browser tab and **join a match**.
2. Open DevTools (F12) in that tab and paste
   [`public/ac-console-demo.js`](public/ac-console-demo.js) (or open
   `/ac-console-demo.js` on your dev server to copy it). Pasting just arms a
   WebSocket hook and defines `window.__ac` — it does nothing yet.
3. Run `__ac.speed()` (10 speed-hack teleports — every one is dropped and
   logged) and `__ac.shootBurst()` (5 rapid rails — 4 rejected).
4. See it caught on the admin dashboard → **Anticheat** tab (5s poll) or via
   `GET /api/admin/anticheat` with your `ADMIN_API_TOKEN`.
5. `__ac.clear()` removes the hook when you're done.
