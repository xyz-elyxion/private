// Instagib Arena — authoritative game server, in-process with the Next app.
//
// Served at `/ws/instagib` on the main app port so it rides the existing
// Cloudflare tunnel (wss://<domain>/ws/instagib) — no separate port/process.
//
// ROOMS: every match is a Room. A socket is either a "lister" (browsing the
// lobby) or "in" exactly one room. Quick-match drops you into an open public
// room (or makes one); Create-Match makes a public ("Custom Lobby") or private
// (invite-only) room. Reaching the frag limit starts an end-of-match MAP VOTE,
// then the room resets onto the winning map.
//
// Trust model: the SERVER decides hits. The shooter sends a shot RAY plus the
// server-clock render time it was displaying others at; the server rewinds
// every other player IN THE SAME ROOM to that time (lag compensation) using a
// position history buffer and raycasts their hitboxes. The client supplies only
// the wall-distance cap (`maxDist`) so the server doesn't need arena geometry.
// Spawns / out-of-bounds use the THREE-free `arena-data` table.
